          It's been about a month since I moved into San Luis Obispo, and I'm
          already in awe of the variety of cuisines that SLO has to offer. The
          city where I'm from has a few common fast food chains and one
          incredibly overpriced restautrant that nobody goes to. So SLO feels
          like a breathe of fresh air! My favorite food spot in SLO has to be
          COYA. So far, that is! Their chicken chaufa is the best chicken and
          rice in town! In my view, it has the perfect combination of spiciness
          and tenderness. The service was incredible, and the entire place had
          these really cute larger-than-life wool llamas. As a broke college
          student, I probably won't be going to this place very often, but I
          will definitely be coming back here on special occasions
